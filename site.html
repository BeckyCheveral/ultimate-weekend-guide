    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <p>
        Here are some things you should know about this guide and Valencia that will help you on your trip!
        <ol>
            <li>The weather is still bright and sunny however it is still windy and gets cold at night so I would recommend packing jeans, t-shirts, jumpers/jackets. You definitely will not need coats though.</li>
            <li>You are going on a Saturday which is the most popular day of the week for the Spanish to go out and shop or party. Therefore you should know that a general rule is to walk on the right side of the pavement on a busy road, also normally when you arrive at a restaurant or bar you can just sit down and get served but double check for queues first.</li>
            <li>Since you are a little way out of the main city the first thing I would recommend doing is getting one of <span class="popup" onclick="myFunction()">these <img class="popupimg" id="myPopup" src="Images\IMG_0791.jpg"></span> tickets which cost 5 euros and have 10 trips on them but you can tap the same card on the scanner one time per person (so for three people you can tap the card three times to let everyone on the public transport). Click <a href="#tickets">here</a> for a guide on getting these tickets.</li>
            <li>Most people in the city centre will speak English. But here are a few phrases and words that will help you get by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Perdona = is said if you bump into someone or in place of "excuse me".</li>
                    <li>Lo siento = is "I´m sorry" and is said more when you do something wrong to someone else.</li>
                    <li>Gracias and por favor = if you don´t know these ones you shouldn´t be going to Spain.</li>
                    <li>Tengo una reserva por... = I have a reservation for... (this will help with the booking I made for you).</li>
                    <li>Hablas ingles? = Do you speak English?</li>
                    <li>Pequeño vino = small wine.</li>
                    <li>Pinta de/grande cerveza = pint of/large beer.</li>
                    <li>Botella/vaso de agua = bottle/glass of water.</li>
                    <li>Puedo tener un/uno... = can I have a... ("un" is masculine "una" is feminine, words ending in "a" are generally feminine others are masculine).</li>
                    <li>Bolsa = bag, people might ask if you need a bag in the super market so just listen for this word when they ask and that´s how you´ll know what they are asking.</li>
                    <li>Tarjeta = card, as in credit card. Say "tarjeta, por favor" to say you want tto pay by card.</li>
                    <li>La cuenta = the bill.</li>
                    <li>Carte de... = in some stores they might ask if you have a card for the shop, listen out for this to understand what they are asking.</li>
                    <li>Un boleta = A ticket, 3 tickets would be "tres billetes".</li>
                </ul>
                It´s worth noting that the letter "c" is pronounced "th" in the Valencian region, the letter "v" is pronounced with your lips like a "b", the letter "ñ" like in "piña" is prounounced "pinya" rather than "pina" or "pequenya/o" rather than "pequena/o" and "ll" is pronounced like a "y". Lastly every letter in Spanish words are pronounced but syllables where there is an accent over a letter are stressed more.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Suggested Itinerary</h3>
        <p id="day1">Day 1:<br>
            <img src="Images\IMG_0318.PNG">
            So I know you are getting in early so I would recommend settling in and maybe napping for a bit then spending the rest of the day adventuring round the city. To get to the city the quickest way to get there would be to get the metro number 3 towards "Aeroport" or 9 towards "Av. del Cid" or "Riba-roja de Túria" and get off at "Xativa". The metro station is across the road from you.<br>
            Here are some good places for lunch:
            <ol>
                <li>"Central bar" is in a really cool food market area and they do really good tapas. If there isn´t any space there are plenty other places in the food market to get food, like paella. But even if you don´t go here for food it is worth having a wonder around the market because the building is pretty and seeing the produce is cool.</li>
                <li>"Boatella" is another good place to get tapas but they do also have other meals.</li>
                <li>"Aladroc taverna de peix" is a place that mainly serves fish but it has had really good recommendations.</li>
                <li>Any of these cafés will be good for a brunch type of lunch: "Bastard coffee" "La más bonita" "Rogel"</li>
            </ol>
            Next I would recommend shopping and wondering around the old town. The best street for shopping is "Carrer de colón" and some surrounding streets (if you want to go here first from the hotel get off the train at "Colón"). Here are some great sights and things to do in the old town:
            <ul>
                <li>"Torres de sorenos" is a look out tower with great views at the top. It is only 2 euros each to go up.</li>
                <li>"La Seú de Valencia" is the cathedral in Valencia, the entrance is in "Plaça de la Reina". It is beautiful but it costs 9 euros to get in and I´m not sure it´s worth that much unless you look at all the information linked on the QR codes around and you go up the bell tower that starts at the exit of the cathedral</li>
                <li>"Plaça de la virgen" is the square on the other side of the cathedral that is gorgeous. "Café de las horas" is just off of this square and it serves "agua de Valencia" which is the cocktail of Valencia, you can get a litre jug for 22 euros but I don´t know if Imogen will be able to get in and I´m pretty sure it opens at 10pm. But if you see this drink advertised any where else you should definitely grab a glass.</li>
                <li>"Café Juliet" serves AMAZING cookies.</li>
                <li>"Jardí Botànic" is somewhere I haven´t been to yet but I have heard it is so beautiful.</li>
            </ul>
            Your booking at "Begin" is at 7pm. If you aren´t to tired after and you want to try go to a bar after (although I am not sure if Imogen will be allowed in) "Atenea" is an amazing rooftop bar nearby. But you might have to decide earlier if you want to go because you have to book it in advance.

        <p id="day2">Day 2:<br>
            <img src="Images\IMG_0317.PNG">
            Hopefully on this day you will be well rested and be ready for lots of walking! Because some non-optional activities for today are walking through Turia park and around the science and arts centre.<br>
            <br>
            If you want to head straight to Turia park get the metro number 3 towards "Aeroport" or 9 towards "Av. del Cid" or "Riba-roja de Túria" to the stop "Alameda", you will be in Turia park when you walk out of the station. Optionally before you get to the park you can walk from your hotel down "calle de Cavanilles" to "Jardins del Real/Vivers" and walk through this park to Turia park then go left and keep walking through the park until you get to a building that looks really out of place, sort of sci-fi and modern looking building. This is the science and arts centre. <br>
            <br>
            An alternative to walking is cycling. You can get a "Valenbici" bike through the parks to the science and arts centre, I think these bikes are similar to Borris bikes and you have to get the app to rent the bikes but I´m not actually certain because I haven´t gotten one before (we all know I am a liability on a bike).<br>
            <br>
            Walking around the science and arts centre is so cool! I think when you get there the first building you see is the arts building, the dome after it is the hemispheric cinema, then it´s the science building. Opposite the science building there´s an arc structure with palm trees in above the car park, this is "Umbracle". The first half of "Umbracle" is the club I´ve told you oh so much about but you can walk through the second half and look at the plants. If you go to the other side of Umbracle there a shopping centre which might be good to shop round, but there´s an even better shopping mall called "aqua mall" which is on the other side of the science and arts centre.<br>
            <br>
            Another option is you can keep walking past the science building and even further down the road past "Caixa" bank and there is the "oceanografic" which as you can probably guess is the oceonarium and obviously this isn´t everybodys cup of tea, I found it quite depressing, but it is cool to see and wander around. To get into any of the buildings at the science and arts centre you have to book tickets online before.<br>
            <br>
            Now I haven´t done this before but I know that if you were to keep travelling in this direction past the oceonografic you will eventually hit the beach or the port and I think you can get there is you keep going through Turia park, however I am not certain about this.<br>
            If you want food: 
            <ol>
                <li>"Vips" is a restaurant in the mall that is the other side of "umbracle", it is a Spanish chain that is a little pricey but the portions are huge and the food is insane.</li>
                <li>"Voltereta, bienvenido a Kioto" is a Japanese restaurant that has been recommended to me.</li>
                <li>"La Cabanyita" is a restaurant by the beach which might be a little far to go but I´ve heard really good things and it has more authentic Spanish food.</li>
            </ol>
            These are the places I´d recommend but I am sure there are loads more good food places in the malls or dotted around the science and arts centre.

        <h3>How to get your public transport tickets:</h3>
        <p>
            So at the metro station or tram stop there will be a machine that has a screen that looks like this:
            <img src="Images\IMG_0325.PNG">
            You can change the language at the bottom of the screen but it doesn´t translate all the options so I have drawn what the options you need to select will look like in Spanish. You need to select "comprar" or buy to begin with then the screen will ask you what kind of ticket you want and I can´t remember what order these are asked in but this is what each of the screens will look like and the option you need to select: 
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="Images\IMG_0322.PNG">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="Images\IMG_0323.PNG">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="Images\IMG_0324.PNG">
                </div>
            </div>
        
            To pay I think there is a confirmation page before the payent screen but there are two options for paying: "credito" is to pay by card (you can pay contactless too), "effectivo" is if you wnat to pay cash.
            <img src="Images\IMG_0321.PNG">
            For each method of public transport there is a different way of scanning your card. The metro is eactly the same as the London underground so if you want to use the same transport card for multiple people you need to pass the card back to the next person before you go through the gate. The bus is another good way of getting into the city centre, I think you need to get the 70 but you can make sure on google maps, this is what the machine where you scan your card looks like and the arrow is where you tap the card:
            <img src="Images\IMG_0320.PNG">
            Where I have drawn a line and written "Vitages" after shows how many trips you have left on the card (I can´t remember if this is the correct word but it will look something like "vitages"). If you´ve seen anywhere else you want to explore outside of the city or in the city buses are a really good way of getting around as there are so many that come frequently. Google maps is really good at telling you what bus you need to get at what time etc. I don´t think you will need a tram but just in case you need to scan yoru card before you get on the tram and this is what the machine looks like:
            <img src="Images\IMG_0319.PNG">
            The tram mainly goes to the beach (the number 6 to "maritim" get off at "malva-rosa") or the university. But if you want to see my flat or Darcey you would get there on the number 6 tram heading toward "Tossal del Rei" and get off at "Sant Miquel dels Reis" then cross the main road and keep walking in that direction then you´ll be near my road. It is probably easier to follow google maps than my directions at this point, although it will probably tell you to get the number 16 bus closer to my flat but you don´t need to do this because it is a walkable distance.
